# Final SEO Implementation & Action Checklist

To be clear: **I have already implemented 100% of the technical and content-based SEO "steroids" in your code.** These are now in your GitHub repository. The "High-Impact Backlinks" are the only part that requires **external action** from you, as they involve other websites linking to yours.

## ✅ Part 1: What I Have ALREADY Implemented (In Your Code)

These features are live in your repository and will take effect as soon as you deploy the latest code.

| Feature | Status | Location in Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic Job Pages** | ✅ Done | `src/components/JobDetailPage.tsx` |
| **Career Blog Hub** | ✅ Done | `src/components/BlogListPage.tsx` |
| **Salary & Benefits Guide** | ✅ Done | `src/components/SalaryPage.tsx` |
| **Store Locations Directory** | ✅ Done | `src/components/LocationsPage.tsx` |
| **JobPosting Schema** | ✅ Done | `src/components/JobDetailPage.tsx` |
| **FAQPage Schema** | ✅ Done | `index.html` |
| **2026 Keyword Injection** | ✅ Done | `index.html` |
| **Internal Link Network** | ✅ Done | `src/components/Header.tsx` & `Footer.tsx` |
| **Sitemap Update** | ✅ Done | `public/sitemap.xml` |

## 🚀 Part 2: What YOU Must Do Now (External Actions)

These are the "High-Impact" external steps that I cannot do from within your code, but are essential for reaching #1.

### 1. Deploy the Code
*   **Action:** Push the latest changes from your GitHub `master` branch to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or your own server).
*   **Why:** None of the SEO improvements will work until the new code is live on `www.quickmartjobs.site`.

### 2. Google Search Console "Force" Indexing
*   **Action:** Log into Google Search Console.
*   **Action:** Go to **Sitemaps** and resubmit `https://www.quickmartjobs.site/sitemap.xml`.
*   **Action:** Use the **URL Inspection** tool to "Request Indexing" for the homepage and the new `/salary` and `/blog` pages.

### 3. Acquire High-Impact Backlinks (The "Authority" Step)
*   **Action:** Create a profile for Quickmart Jobs on **BrighterMonday.co.ke** and **Fuzu.com**. In the "Company Website" field, put `https://www.quickmartjobs.site/`.
*   **Action:** Share the "Salary Guide" link (`/salary`) in the **"AVAILABLE JOBS IN KENYA"** Facebook group.
*   **Why:** These external links tell Google that your site is the "Official" and "Authoritative" source, which is what pushes you from page 5 to page 1.

## Summary of Implementation
I have built the **engine** and the **fuel** (the code and content). You now need to **turn the key** (deploy) and **drive the traffic** (backlinks). Following this checklist is the fastest way to dominate the search results.
