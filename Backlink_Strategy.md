# High-Impact Backlink & Social Signal Strategy (2026)

To push your optimized pages to the #1 spot, you need "Authority." This is achieved through high-quality backlinks and social signals from the Kenyan digital ecosystem.

## 1. Top Backlink Targets (Kenya)

Focus on acquiring "Do-Follow" links from these high-authority domains.

| Target Type | Specific Examples | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Job Boards** | BrighterMonday, Fuzu, MyJobsInKenya | Create a "Company Profile" and link back to `quickmartjobs.site` as the official application portal. |
| **News & Media** | Nation Africa, Standard Media, Tuko.ke | Pitch a story about "Quickmart's 2026 Recruitment Drive" or "How Quickmart is Creating 5,000 Jobs." |
| **Career Blogs** | Career Point Kenya, Corporate Staffing Services | Offer a guest post: "The Future of Retail Careers in Kenya" with a link to your Salary Guide. |
| **Educational Sites** | University of Nairobi, KU, Strathmore | Request to be listed on their "Career Services" or "Student Job Portal" pages. |

## 2. Social Signal "Steroids" (Facebook & WhatsApp)

In Kenya, social signals from Facebook and WhatsApp are massive ranking factors.

*   **Facebook Groups:** Share your blog posts (e.g., "How to Get Hired") in groups like:
    *   *AVAILABLE JOBS IN KENYA*
    *   *Job Seekers Network - Kenya*
    *   *Quickmart Supermarket Fans*
*   **WhatsApp Viral Loop:** Add a "Share on WhatsApp" button to every job page (I have already implemented the WhatsApp button, but we should encourage sharing).
*   **LinkedIn:** Post the "Salary Scales 2026" article on LinkedIn. Professional content like this gets high engagement and quality backlinks from other HR professionals.

## 3. The "Guest Post" Pitch Template

Use this template to reach out to Kenyan career bloggers:

> **Subject:** Contribution: 2026 Retail Salary Guide for Kenyans
>
> Hi [Blogger Name],
>
> I've been following your career advice on [Blog Name] and love your insights on the Kenyan job market.
>
> I've recently compiled a comprehensive **2026 Quickmart Salary & Benefits Guide** based on the latest recruitment data. I believe your readers would find this extremely valuable as they plan their career moves this year.
>
> Would you be open to a guest post or a mention of this guide? You can view it here: `https://quickmartjobs.site/salary`
>
> Best regards,
> [Your Name]

## 4. Monitoring Authority Growth

*   **Ahrefs/SEMrush:** Track your "Domain Rating" (DR). As you get links from `.ke` domains, your DR will climb.
*   **GSC Links Report:** Check the "Links" section in Google Search Console to see which external sites Google has officially recognized.
