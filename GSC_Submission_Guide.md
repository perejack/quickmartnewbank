# Google Search Console: Submission & Monitoring Strategy (2026)

To ensure the new high-traffic pages and technical optimizations are indexed immediately, follow this precise execution plan in Google Search Console (GSC).

## 1. Immediate Indexing Actions

After deploying the code, perform these steps to "force" Google to recognize the changes.

| Action | Tool in GSC | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resubmit Sitemap** | Indexing > Sitemaps | Notifies Google of the new `/blog`, `/salary`, and `/locations` paths. |
| **URL Inspection** | Top Search Bar | Manually inspect the homepage and click **"Request Indexing"**. |
| **Deep Link Inspection** | Top Search Bar | Manually inspect one URL from each new section (e.g., `/blog/how-to-get-hired-at-quickmart-2026`) and request indexing. |

## 2. Monitoring Rich Results

Since we added advanced Schema (JobPosting, FAQ, BlogPosting), you must monitor the **Enhancements** section in GSC.

*   **Job Snippets:** Ensure the "Job Postings" report shows 0 errors. This is critical for appearing in the Google Jobs vertical.
*   **FAQ Snippets:** Check the "FAQ" report to verify that your Q&A content is eligible for rich results.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Verify that the site hierarchy is correctly recognized to improve SERP appearance.

## 3. Performance Tracking for "Steroid" Ranking

Use the **Performance** report to track your progress toward the top spot.

1.  **Filter by Page:** Monitor clicks and impressions for the `/blog` and `/salary` pages specifically.
2.  **Query Analysis:** Look for new keywords appearing in the report, such as "Quickmart salary 2026" or "Quickmart recruitment portal."
3.  **CTR Optimization:** If a page has high impressions but low clicks, we will need to further refine the Meta Title to be even more "click-baity."

## 4. Troubleshooting Indexing Issues

If pages are "Discovered - currently not indexed":
*   **Internal Linking:** Ensure the Footer and Header links are live (I have already updated these in the code).
*   **Content Quality:** Google may delay indexing if it perceives content as duplicate. The unique blog content I added is designed to prevent this.

**Next Step:** I will now develop the Backlink and Social Signal plan to provide the "authority" needed to push these indexed pages to #1.
